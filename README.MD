# Oracle Social Engagement App

Info & links for OSE app

## App Overview

The goal of the app is to promote employee engagement and build a community vibe by encouraging participation in additional activities including charity events, team building events, community events such as the City to Surf and so on. Employees can be awarded points from participation that go into their team pool. The team with the most points at the end of a given period (maybe quarterly, biannually or annually) will get $20k (as an example) to be donated to a charity of choice.

While this app has a team focus it will also provide a platform for employees to create teams outside their immediate team. We may have a team building activity where you cannot work with people in your team. Through the app you can create teams with members from different LOBs and earn points which you can then put towards your teams total.
